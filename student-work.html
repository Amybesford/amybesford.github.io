            <h2>As a Graphic Communication major at Cal Poly, I combined creativity with technical skills to bring ideas to life in both digital and print formats. Concentrating in Design Reproduction Technology, I blended graphic design, typography, branding, color theory, and quality control—focusing on designs for print, packaging, and digital media.</h2>

                  <h3>Type Comparison Poster</h3>
                  <p>This assignment asked me to select two contrasting fonts and create a design to highlight their similarities and differences. The project involved analyzing characteristics like weight, style, and spacing, and showcasing how they could complement or contrast within a layout.</p>

                  <h3>Recipe Book</h3>
                  <p>In GRC 318, Digital Typography, we explored typography through modern tools for print and digital publishing. I designed a set of recipe pages printed as a small booklet, including moodboarding, layout drafts, food photography.</p>

                  <h3>Hair Care Packaging</h3>
                  <p>For this project I was tasked with redesigning the packaging for a product that helps to address a user issue. I decided to focus on hair care packaging and created a design that holds the podcast as well as refills for a travel sized version. Furthermore we were tasked with addressing accessibility issues as well. I focused on this by creating a handle design that is strong and easy to hold on the box, as well as clear typography throughout the design. Over the course of this project I mood boarded, designed the dieline, created 32 renderings in Esko, and printed out the final version on vinyl and corrugated cardboard.</p>

                  <h3>Playing Cards</h3>
                  <p>One of the earliest projects I completed in Graphic Communication was designing and printing a deck of playing cards. Throughout the course, we learned how to create digital files and explore workflows for both print and web. The class covered topics like file automation, proofing, output systems, and file delivery. My deck had an ocean theme, featuring some of my favourite animals.</p>

                  <p>In Art 102- Art and Design Foundation Studies, we were tasked with illustrating figures of speech in any way we wanted. Originally, I created screen-printed designs for a zine. Later, I transformed them into a digital book to give the work a fresh format and feel.</p>

                  <h3>Social Media Campaign</h3>
                  <p>This social media mockup for Instagram was a part of a larger VDP marketing project for a local music festival, Shabang. As well as designing social media posts, my group and I researched, created personalized marketing materials, email templates, and a large pitch deck of our marketing timeline and plan.</p>

                  <h3>Type Specimen Booklet</h3>
                  <p>This project was to design a type specimen pamphlet showcasing a 21st-century type family. This project was a deep dive into the art and functionality of typography, highlighting the design, history, and application of a specific font family. The project involved researching the font’s background, its designer, and its intended uses. I then created an eight-page pamphlet that celebrated the typeface, combining text and imagery to demonstrate its versatility and artistic qualities.</p>
