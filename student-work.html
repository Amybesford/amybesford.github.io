            <h2>As a Graphic Communication major at Cal Poly, I combined creativity with technical skills to bring ideas to life in both digital and print formats. Concentrating in Design Reproduction Technology, I blended graphic design, typography, branding, color theory, and quality controlâ€”focusing on designs for print, packaging, and digital media.</h2>

                  <h3>Travel Site</h3>
                  <p>Tread was my senior project for the Graphic Communication Department, created to address the environmental and cultural challenges of modern tourism. The platform was designed as a conceptual eco-tourism website that promotes ethical and sustainable travel by connecting users with community-based businesses and culturally respectful experiences. Unlike mainstream travel platforms that often fuel over-tourism and environmental harm, Tread emphasizes "treading lightly", encouraging travelers to make mindful choices that support local economies and protect cultural and natural heritage.</p>

                  <p>The project combined UX design theory, decision-making frameworks, and ethical branding to create a prototype website coded in HTML and CSS. The site features a landing page and destination page, demonstrating how users could discover and book eco-friendly travel options while learning about the impact of tourism. Through cohesive branding, intuitive navigation, and an emphasis on accessibility and trust, Tread illustrates how digital design can serve as both a booking tool and an educational resource. The result is a scalable model that reimagines travel planning as a force for environmental and social good.</p>

                  <h3>Magazine Design</h3>
                  <p> For this project, we were given 10 weeks to design and produce a magazine, and I chose to create mine around highlighting the culture, fashion, and creative communities that define individual cities. Each issue is built around showcasing locally made brands, diverse businesses, and inspiring individuals, encouraging readers to shop small and engage more deeply with their community. By focusing on San Francisco for the first issue, the magazine pushes back against stereotypes of the city and instead spotlights its vibrant, funky, and innovative culture.</p>
              <p>The design emphasizes a modern, clean, and visually engaging aesthetic, with striking photography and dynamic layouts that position the magazine as both stylish and community-focused. A bold, image-driven cover with no cover lines reinforces its collectible, coffee-table quality, while inside content features unique brands, cultural stories, and interviews with local creatives. Targeted toward Gen Z through Gen X readers who value sustainability, ethical shopping, and authentic cultural experiences, the magazine combines editorial storytelling with design strategy to promote local business and celebrate the character of each city.

                  <h3>Type Comparison Poster</h3>
                  <p>This assignment asked me to select two contrasting fonts and create a design to highlight their similarities and differences. The project involved analyzing characteristics like weight, style, and spacing, and showcasing how they could complement or contrast within a layout.</p>

                  <p>In GRC 318, Digital Typography, we explored typography through modern tools for print and digital publishing. I designed a set of recipe pages printed as a small booklet, including moodboarding, layout drafts, food photography.</p>

                  <h3>Hair Care Packaging</h3>
                  <p>For this project I was tasked with redesigning the packaging for a product that helps to address a user issue. I decided to focus on hair care packaging and created a design that holds the podcast as well as refills for a travel sized version. Furthermore we were tasked with addressing accessibility issues as well. I focused on this by creating a handle design that is strong and easy to hold on the box, as well as clear typography throughout the design. Over the course of this project I mood boarded, designed the dieline, created 32 renderings in Esko, and printed out the final version on vinyl and corrugated cardboard.</p>

                  <p>One of the earliest projects I completed in Graphic Communication was designing and printing a deck of playing cards. Throughout the course, we learned how to create digital files and explore workflows for both print and web. The class covered topics like file automation, proofing, output systems, and file delivery. My deck had an ocean theme, featuring some of my favourite animals.</p>

                  <p>This project was to design a type specimen pamphlet showcasing a 21st-century type family. This project was a deep dive into the art and functionality of typography, highlighting the design, history, and application of a specific font family. The project involved researching the font's background, its designer, and its intended uses. I then created an eight-page pamphlet that celebrated the typeface, combining text and imagery to demonstrate its versatility and artistic qualities.</p>
