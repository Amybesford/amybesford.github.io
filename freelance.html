               <h3>Sandpiper Hotel Instagram</h3>
               <p>For the Sandpiper Hotel, I led a full website redesign that modernized the brand’s digital presence while keeping a clean, welcoming aesthetic that reflects the property’s beachside charm. I restructured the site architecture to improve navigation, created clear calls-to-action such as “Book Now,” and designed visually engaging layouts to showcase accommodations, local activities, and surrounding attractions. By incorporating high-quality photography and consistent typography, the new site balances functionality with storytelling—making it easier for visitors to explore room options, learn about Stinson Beach, and seamlessly complete their booking.

               <h3>Unveiled Salon Branding</h3>
               <p>Work created for Unveiled Salon and Spa Suites, a local, women-owned business in San Luis Obispo. For this freelance project, I provided a range of creative services to strengthen the brand’s presence both digitally and in-person. My work included managing social media content and strategy, capturing professional photography to showcase the salon’s spaces and services, and designing logos for both signage and digital use. Through this mix of branding, visual storytelling, and digital marketing, I helped Unveiled build a cohesive identity that reflects its modern, welcoming, and community-centered values.
