               <h3>Unveiled Salon Branding</h3>
               <p>Work created for Unveiled Salon and Spa Suites, a local, women-owned business in San Luis Obispo. For this freelance project, I provided a range of creative services to strengthen the brand’s presence both digitally and in-person. My work included managing social media content and strategy, capturing professional photography to showcase the salon’s spaces and services, and designing logos for both signage and digital use. Through this mix of branding, visual storytelling, and digital marketing, I helped Unveiled build a cohesive identity that reflects its modern, welcoming, and community-centered values.

               <h3>Sandpiper Hotel Instagram</h3>
               <p> For The Sandpiper Hotel in Stinson Beach, I created a comprehensive social media content plan designed to highlight the hotel’s unique character and coastal charm. The project included developing a consistent visual style, curating photography, and drafting post concepts that emphasized the property’s family-friendly atmosphere and local connections. By aligning content with the hotel’s brand voice and seasonal offerings, the plan provided a clear roadmap for consistent posting, audience engagement, and stronger digital visibility.</p>
